# Sales & Finance Report
## Overview:
AtliQ Hardware is a leading global hardware manufacturer, selling products to various customers like Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, Staples, Best Buy, etc. which are grouped by three channels, naming Retailer, Direct and Distributor. They needed data driven insights for making informed decisions. They were facing challenges in finding insights from the data which had over 1.5 million records so, I was given the task to create Sales & Finance Reports and find insights from the data.

## Steps:
1.	Data Import
Loaded the data to excel which were provided as a CSV file.

2.	ETL (Extract Transform Load) process
Loaded the tables into Power Query, ensuring data uniqueness, data integrity and correcting error in the data if any, before integrating in Power Pivot.

3.	Data Modelling
Implemented a Star Schema / Snowflake Schema relationship between tables, created a date table with a fiscal year and seamlessly integrated with other tables.

4.	Pivot Table & Power Pivot Table
Integrated the data with Pivot Table for any Quick Analysis. Utilised Power Pivot for transformation and in-depth analysis.

5.	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Developed multiple new measures and columns using DAX, including Net Sales, Gross Margin, Gross Margin % (GM%), COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and created a year wise filter for deeper insights.

6.	User Empathetic Design
Applied Conditional Formatting to enhance data presentation, Highlighting key information, and improving overall data readability.
